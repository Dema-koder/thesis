\begin{abstract}

The paper compares the performance of Java garbage collectors (Serial, Parallel, G1, ZGC, Shenandoah) on typical Spring Boot web applications. Existing research uses synthetic benchmarks (DaCapo) or application-specific (Cassandra), leaving a gap in understanding GC behavior in common web services with REST APIs, databases, and caching.

The work includes a review of the literature on GC theory and architecture, the development of a testing methodology tailored to the specifics of web applications, and conducting experiments on a reference Spring Boot application. The latest JDK 17 LTS and JDK 21 LTS are used, including modern low-latency assemblers that have not been studied before in web applications. Special attention is paid to the metrics critical for production: tail latency (p99, p999), SLA compliance, distribution of delays under load.

Results --- practical recommendations for choosing and configuring GC: decision tree and migration guidelines for real enterprise applications. The work fills in research gaps and provides applicable solutions for optimizing Java web applications.
